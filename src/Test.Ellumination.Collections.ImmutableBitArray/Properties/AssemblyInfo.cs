//// General Information about an assembly is controlled through the following 
//// set of attributes. Change these attribute values to modify the information
//// associated with an assembly.
//[assembly: AssemblyTitle("Kingdom.Collections.ImmutableBitArray.Tests")]
//[assembly: AssemblyDescription("")]

//// Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible 
//// to COM components.  If you need to access a type in this assembly from 
//// COM, set the ComVisible attribute to true on that type.
//[assembly: ComVisible(false)]

//// The following GUID is for the ID of the typelib if this project is exposed to COM
//[assembly: Guid("d65c3e55-d969-491d-8d40-9884b504c3ae")]

//// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
////
////      Major Version
////      Minor Version 
////      Build Number
////      Revision
////
//// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
//// by using the '*' as shown below:
//// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
///* Would have been a major 2.0 notwithstanding XUnit/Combinatorial snafus, on many fronts */
//[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.5.1.46")]
//[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.5.1.40")]

//// Going on a hunch. I do not know why parallelism should be an issue at the moment,
//// but let's get a handle on that and see whether things do not improve at all.
//[assembly: CollectionBehavior(DisableTestParallelization = true)]
